# advanced-conditional-cod-payment-system


== Description ==

Advanced Conditional COD Payment System plugin lets WooCommerce store owners set up a conditional advance payment requirement for Cash on Delivery (COD) orders. When the order total exceeds a specified amount, customers must pay a percentage of the total order amount in advance using other payment methods. The plugin provides a checkbox during checkout, and when checked, it calculates the advance payment and hides the COD option. Customers will receive an order confirmation with the details of the advance payment and the remaining amount to be paid upon delivery.
